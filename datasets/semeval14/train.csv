another reason given by the court for invalidating the new york rule is that it is inherently unfair and therefore unconstitutional to permit the jury to pass on voluntariness since the jury even though finding a confession to have been coerced may nevertheless be unwilling to follow the courts instruction to disregard it because it may also believe the confession is true the defendant is guilty and a guilty person ought not be allowed to escape punishment,defendant,-1,379,388
